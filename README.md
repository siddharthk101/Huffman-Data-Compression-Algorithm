# Huffman-Data-Compression-Algorithm

This project implements the Huffman Coding Procedure for data compression and decompression.

Given a text file 'text.txt', the program will compress the data into file text.hf.
Given a Huffman Compressed file text.hf, the program will decompress the data into file text.txt.
